# Facebook/Meta Video Ads Strategy: High-Converting Copy for Your Spiritual Wellness Retreat in Mexico

## Executive Summary

High-ticket wellness retreats require sophisticated ad copy that bridges the gap between emotional pain points and transformational outcomes. Based on comprehensive research of Meta's current performance metrics, compliance requirements, and Spanish-language marketing best practices for Mexico, your retreat can command premium positioning through strategic messaging tailored to each avatar's specific psychological triggers.

**Key Performance Benchmarks**: Video ads generate 19% higher CTR than static creative, with testimonial-driven content increasing conversions by 50-70%. For high-ticket offers (\$2,000-3,000), cost-per-booked-call is the critical metric, not lead volume.

**Critical Meta Compliance Note**: Plant medicine and spiritual wellness ads face heightened restrictions. Avoid medical claims ("heals anxiety," "treats PTSD"), "guaranteed results," or health benefit language. Frame as spiritual exploration and consciousness work, not therapeutic treatment.

***

## 1. Ad Copy Structure \& Character Limits

Meta's text placement architecture is unforgiving—clarity requires understanding exact truncation points:


| **Element** | **Visible Characters** | **Optimal Length** | **Best Practice** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Primary Text** | ~125 characters before "See More" | 75-100 characters | Front-load core emotion + benefit in first 80 characters |
| **Headline** | ~27 characters (visible), 40 character limit | 25-35 characters | Benefit-driven, specific outcome, curiosity trigger |
| **Description** | ~30 characters | 25-30 characters | Optional; reinforces CTA or emotion |

**Critical Structure for This Campaign:**

- **Line 1 (First 80 chars)**: Pain point recognition OR curiosity gap opener
- **Line 2 (80-125 chars)**: Transformation promise OR specific outcome
- **Headline**: Destination benefit (what they get)
- **CTA Button**: "Schedule Consultation" (never "Submit" or generic actions)

**Pro Tip**: Create 3-5 primary text variations + 3-5 headline variations for dynamic optimization. Meta's algorithm performs best with 3-5 copy options per campaign.

***

## 2. Performance Advantages of Video Ads

Your choice to focus on video ads is strategically sound:

- **19% higher CTR** vs. static images (1.2% vs. 1.01%)[^1]
- **19% lower CPM** (\$21.17 vs. \$26.11)[^1]
- **Best Aspect Ratio**: 4:5 (vertical feed) for Facebook
- **Ideal Length**: Under 15 seconds (first 3 seconds are make-or-break)
- **Critical Detail**: 83% of viewers watch video without sound—closed captions mandatory

**Video Structure for Retreat Ads**:

1. **0-3 seconds**: Powerful visual hook (real footage, transformation moment, or compelling face)
2. **3-8 seconds**: Primary pain point acknowledgment (conversational tone)
3. **8-13 seconds**: Transformation promise + testimonial quote or retreat scene
4. **13-15 seconds**: CTA + landing page (clear, clickable button)

***

## 3. Emotional Triggers Mapped to Your Pain Points

Research shows ads evoking specific emotional responses convert significantly better than benefit-focused copy alone. For your three pain points, the most effective emotional triggers differ:[^2][^3]

### DUELO (Grief/Loss)

**Primary Emotions**: Vulnerability → Recognition → Hope → Connection

**Psychological Science**: Grief is isolating. The most powerful trigger for a grieving person is feeling *seen and understood*—acknowledged without judgment or toxic positivity.[^4][^5]

**What Works**:

- "You're not carrying this alone"
- "There's a space for what your heart couldn't hold"
- "Honoring what you lost is honoring what you loved"
- Recognition language ("If you've lost someone important")

**What FAILS**:

- "Move on" energy
- "Everything happens for a reason"
- Rushed closure messaging
- Clinical tone ("grief processing")


### PROPÓSITO (Purpose/Meaning)

**Primary Emotions**: Recognition of emptiness → Restlessness → Hope → Clarity

**Psychological Science**: Purpose-seeking emerges when success feels hollow. The trigger works best when acknowledging cognitive dissonance: "You've done everything right... but something's missing."[^3][^6]

**What Works**:

- "Success that feels empty is your soul's signal"
- "What if the job isn't your real work?"
- "Your ambition deserves an equal inner life"
- Reframing language ("This emptiness isn't a problem—it's an invitation")

**What FAILS**:

- Generic "find yourself" language (every retreat says this)
- Pushing spiritual concepts too hard
- Implying current life is worthless


### ESTRÉS (Stress/Burnout)

**Primary Emotions**: Recognition → Desperation → Relief → Control

**Psychological Science**: Burnout differs from stress—it's the combination of isolation, reactivity, and nervous system depletion. The most effective trigger acknowledges the *loneliness* of high performance.[^7][^8]

**What Works**:

- "You can't outrun burnout"
- "Your nervous system is asking for help" (frames stress as signal, not failure)
- "Real leaders know when to pause"
- Community language ("You're not alone in this")

**What FAILS**:

- "Eliminate stress" (unrealistic, scientifically wrong)
- "Quick fix" energy
- Shame-based approaches

***

## 4. Avatar-Specific Messaging Framework

Your three avatars require completely different copy positioning. **Same video, different primary text per avatar.** Run separate ad sets.

### Avatar 1: Urban Entrepreneurs (28-45) — CDMX, Guadalajara, Monterrey

**Psychology**: Success-driven, time-aware, results-oriented. They've optimized their businesses but neglected their inner lives. Respond to ROI language and personal growth metrics.

**Pain Point Angle**: "You built the empire. Who did you sacrifice to build it?"

**Primary Text Hook Examples**:


| **Pain Point** | **Hook (Primary Text - First 80 chars)** | **Headline** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **DUELO** | "The loss you haven't processed is running your business. What if it could guide it instead?" | Transform Grief into Wisdom |
| **PROPÓSITO** | "Your success looks impressive. Your soul looks exhausted. A 5-day answer in Tepoztlán." | Redefine Success |
| **ESTRÉS** | "Every decision is yours. The weight? That's burnout disguised as responsibility." | Strategic Clarity Starts Here |

**Avatar-Specific Language**: Use "clarity," "aligned," "strategy," "breakthrough," "vision." Emphasize decision quality and leadership impact.

**CTA for Entrepreneurs**: "Schedule Your Strategy Call" (frames consultation as strategic, not therapeutic)

***

### Avatar 2: Wellness Seekers (18-65+) — National Reach

**Psychology**: Spiritually open, transformation-focused, emotionally aware. They've done yoga, meditation, self-help. Respond to authenticity, depth, and real transformation stories.

**Pain Point Angle**: "What if healing isn't about fixing yourself—it's about honoring yourself?"

**Primary Text Hook Examples**:


| **Pain Point** | **Hook (Primary Text)** | **Headline** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **DUELO** | "Grief lives in your body until you honor it. Tepoztlán offers the space. Are you ready?" | Honor Your Loss Fully |
| **PROPÓSITO** | "You've searched everywhere outside yourself. What if what you're seeking is within?" | Reconnect With Your Purpose |
| **ESTRÉS** | "Burnout isn't weakness. It's your deepest wisdom saying: slow down, go inward, transform." | Heal From the Inside Out |

**Avatar-Specific Language**: Use "journey," "awakening," "wholeness," "healing," "sacred," "soul," "authentic." Emphasize spiritual depth and transformation experience.

**CTA for Wellness Seekers**: "Claim Your Spot" or "Learn More" (less committal, more exploratory)

***

### Avatar 3: Premium C-Suite Executives (30-50) — High-Value Neighborhoods

**Psychology**: Sophisticated, performance-optimized, status-aware. Burnout is acute but they can't admit weakness. Respond to exclusivity, peer community, and strategic advantage.

**Pain Point Angle**: "Leading well requires knowing yourself deeply. Most leaders never get there."

**Primary Text Hook Examples**:


| **Pain Point** | **Hook (Primary Text)** | **Headline** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **DUELO** | "The loss you're carrying is affecting every decision you make. What if processing it is leadership?" | Lead From Wholeness |
| **PROPÓSITO** | "You've maximized everything except meaning. 5 days for clarity. Invitation only." | Executive Clarity Retreat |
| **ESTRÉS** | "Burnout affects 57% of C-suite. Real leaders manage it with intention. Learn how in Tepoztlán." | Sustainable Peak Performance |

**Avatar-Specific Language**: Use "executive," "invitation," "peer community," "strategic leadership," "sustainable performance," "select group." Emphasize exclusivity and peer quality.

**CTA for C-Suite**: "Schedule Your Application Call" (frame as qualification process, not sales)

***

## 5. Spanish-Language Optimization for Mexico

This is where 90% of retreat ads fail. Direct English-to-Spanish translation kills emotional resonance.[^9][^10]

### Critical Guidelines

**DO:**

- Hire a **native Spanish speaker** (preferably from Mexico/CDMX region) to write original copy
- Use **transcreation**, not translation—culturally adapted messaging
- Create **separate campaigns** for Spanish (never use Meta's auto-translate)
- Target: Language = Spanish + Location = Mexico + Affinity = Hispanic/Mexican culture
- Incorporate **Mexican cultural values** (familismo, respeto, espiritualidad)

**DON'T:**

- Use Google Translate or automatic translators
- Translate English copy literally
- Use Spanish from Spain (different slang, formal tone)
- Mix English and Spanish in same ad (unless intentionally bilingual for specific younger urban demographic)
- Assume "wellness" translates universally (it doesn't)


### Mexican Cultural Values for Messaging[^11][^12][^13]

| **Cultural Value** | **How to Leverage in Ads** | **Example** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Familismo** (family unity) | Frame healing as strengthening family bonds | "Heal yourself to show up fully for your family" |
| **Respeto** (respect for wisdom) | Honor ancestral practices + facilitator expertise | "Guided by shamans with decades of lineage" |
| **Spirituality/Faith** | Complement (not replace) their religious beliefs | "Honors all spiritual paths" |
| **Comunidad** (community) | Emphasize shared experience + belonging | "Join others seeking transformation" |
| **Bien Estar Integral** (holistic wellness) | Address mind-body-spirit-family connection | "Heal yourself. Strengthen your family. Reclaim your purpose." |

### Spanish-Language Ad Examples (Original Transcreation)

**Avatar 1: Entrepreneur (ESTRÉS)**

*Original English Hook*: "Every decision is yours. The weight? That's burnout disguised as responsibility."

*Spanish Transcreation*:
> "Construiste todo. Pero ¿para quién? Descubre qué realmente importa en 5 días en Tepoztlán."
>
> *Translation value: "You built everything. But for whom? Discover what really matters in 5 days in Tepoztlán."*

**Avatar 2: Wellness Seeker (DUELO)**

*Original English Hook*: "Grief lives in your body until you honor it. Tepoztlán offers the space."

*Spanish Transcreation*:
> "El dolor que no procesaste sigue viviendo en ti. En Tepoztlán, finalmente puedes soltarlo con honor."
>
> *Translation value: "The pain you haven't processed still lives in you. In Tepoztlán, you can finally release it with honor."*

**Avatar 3: C-Suite (PROPÓSITO)**

*Original English Hook*: "You've maximized everything except meaning. Invitation only."

*Spanish Transcreation*:
> "Llegaste a la cúpula. Pero ¿a dónde va tu alma? Una invitación para líderes excepcionales."
>
> *Translation value: "You reached the top. But where is your soul going? An invitation for exceptional leaders."*

**Critical**: Work with a copywriter who understands not just Spanish, but Mexican business culture, spiritual traditions, and how premium audiences in CDMX/Polanco speak about personal transformation.

***

## 6. Hook Formulas That Stop Scrolling

The first 80 characters of primary text determine whether someone stops scrolling. Below are formulas proven to trigger engagement for pain points:[^1]

### Hook Formula 1: The Vulnerable Recognition

**Structure**: "I was [painful state]. Then [change]. Now [outcome]."

**For Entrepreneurs/ESTRÉS**:
> "Construí un imperio de éxito. A los 42, me enfrenté a un colapso. Lo que encontré en Tepoztlán cambió mi definición de victoria."

**For Wellness Seekers/DUELO**:
> "Llevaba 3 años fingiendo estar bien. En Tepoztlán, finalmente me permitieron caer. Y encontré mi fuerza ahí."

**For C-Suite/PROPÓSITO**:
> "CEO, director general, padre exitoso. Pero vacío. ¿Sabes el sentimiento? Hay una salida."

### Hook Formula 2: The Powerful Question

**Structure**: "What if [reframe]? / Have you ever [pain point]? / ¿Qué pasaría si [transformation]?"

**For Entrepreneurs/ESTRÉS**:
> "¿Qué pasaría si tu burnout fuera sabiduría? Un retiro para líderes que necesitan claridad."

**For Wellness Seekers/PROPÓSITO**:
> "¿Buscaste tu propósito en todos lados? ¿Si estuviera dentro de ti todo este tiempo?"

**For C-Suite/DUELO**:
> "La pérdida que no procesaste está afectando cada decisión que tomas. ¿Y si pudieras sanarla?"

### Hook Formula 3: The Specific Statistic + Reframe

**Structure**: "[\# of people] feel [pain]. The solution isn't [common assumption]. It's [reframe]."

**For Entrepreneurs/PROPÓSITO**:
> "8 de 10 emprendedores exitosos admiten sentir vacío. No es depresión. Es una invitación a profundizar."

**For Wellness Seekers/ESTRÉS**:
> "El 73% de personas en bienestar reporta que el estrés se disolvió en 5 días. ¿Cómo? Yendo adentro."

### Hook Formula 4: The Controversial Take (Use Carefully)

**Structure**: "Everyone says [common belief]. The truth is [reframe]."

**For C-Suite/ESTRÉS**:
> "Dicen que los líderes no se permiten colapsar. Mentira. Los mejores líderes entienden cuándo pausar."

**For Wellness Seekers/DUELO**:
> "Supuestamente deberías 'superar' la pérdida. En realidad, necesitas honrarla. Eso es sanar."

***

## 7. Headline Formulas (25-40 Characters)

Headlines reinforce benefit and trigger click. Best headlines are specific, benefit-driven, and promise transformation:


| **Pain Point** | **Headline (Keep ≤40 chars)** | **Why It Works** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **DUELO** | "Honor Your Loss Fully" | Validates grief, removes shame |
|  | "Release What Weighs You" | Specific outcome, emotional |
| **PROPÓSITO** | "Reclaim Your Purpose" | Clear benefit, action verb |
|  | "From Empty to Alive" | Before/after transformation |
| **ESTRÉS** | "Burnout to Breakthrough" | Journey arc, hope |
|  | "Lead With Clarity" | Aspirational, specific |

**Pro Tip**: Test both internal-focused ("Reclaim Your Purpose") and external-focused ("Lead Your Best Life") headlines. Different avatars respond differently.

***

## 8. Call-to-Action Best Practices for High-Ticket Consultation Booking

For \$2,000-3,000 offers, the CTA must feel non-salesy yet urgent. Meta button options and ad copy CTAs should align:


| **Avatar** | **Meta Button CTA** | **Why (Not Generic "Buy Now")** | **Copy Reference** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Entrepreneurs** | "Schedule Your Strategy Call" | Frames as strategic, not therapeutic | "Learn how \$3k investment pays for itself in clarity" |
| **Wellness Seekers** | "Claim Your Spot" | Scarcity + agency | "Limited to 12 participants per retreat" |
| **C-Suite** | "Apply Now" or "Learn More" | Exclusive/qualification positioning | "Invitation-based. Applications reviewed" |

**Avoid**:

- "Buy Now" (sounds transactional)
- "Submit" (generic, friction)
- "Sign Up" (implies low-commitment)
- "Get Started" (overused)

**CTA Copy Integration Examples**:

*For Entrepreneurs*:
> "Schedule Your Strategy Call" — Your consultation includes a brief assessment (\$300 value, complimentary) + personalized pathway to clarity in Tepoztlán.

*For Wellness Seekers*:
> "Claim Your Spot" — Only 12 participants per retreat. Most fill 4-6 weeks in advance. Spots include pre-ceremony preparation.

*For C-Suite*:
> "Apply Now" — Our application ensures the right group dynamic. You'll speak with our director within 48 hours.

***

## 9. Testimonial \& Credibility Integration

**Critical Data**: Video testimonials increase conversions by 50-70% vs. text-only.[^14][^15][^16][^17]

### Video Testimonial Structure (30-60 seconds)

1. **Opening (5-8 seconds)**: Who they were + pain point (conversational, relatable)
2. **Turning Point (5-8 seconds)**: What they felt during retreat
3. **Transformation (10-15 seconds)**: Specific change (behavioral, emotional, clarity-based)
4. **Why It Matters (5-8 seconds)**: How this affects their life now
5. **CTA Tie-In (3-5 seconds)**: "I'd do it again" or "Worth every peso"

**Testimonial Copy Examples**:

*Entrepreneur Speaking to Stress*:
> "I came here exhausted, pretending I had it all figured out. By day 3, I realized I'd been running from myself. Now I'm running toward something real. My business is better. My family has me back. This wasn't what I expected—it was what I needed."

*Wellness Seeker Speaking to Grief*:
> "Three years I carried this loss. Nobody wanted to talk about it. In this retreat, I realized my grief was love. That shifted everything. I finally felt like I could breathe again—and honor her memory fully."

*C-Suite Speaking to Purpose*:
> "I've sat in boardrooms with billion-dollar budgets. This 5-day retreat clarified more about my actual priorities than 20 years of strategy sessions. It's not wellness tourism. It's executive reality-checking."

**Integration Strategy for Ads**:

- Use 15-30 second testimonial clips in video ad (strongest performers)
- Pull 1-2 sentence quotes into ad copy OR headline
- Include client first names + profession ("María, Emprendedora CDMX") for credibility
- For C-Suite: Use LinkedIn-style credibility (title + transformation)

***

## 10. Meta Compliance Guidelines for Wellness/Spiritual Ads

Meta's 2025 health \& wellness restrictions are stringent. Non-compliance = ad rejection, account restrictions, or bans.[^18][^19][^20][^21][^22]

### PROHIBITED Language

**Never use these terms** (even if true):

- "Cure," "Heal," "Treat," "Prevent" (medical claims)
- "Guaranteed," "Clinically proven," "FDA approved"
- Specific mental health condition claims ("Eliminates anxiety," "Cures depression")
- "Instant relief," "Quick fix"
- Before/after mental health states in visuals
- Direct health data sharing (depression levels, anxiety scores)


### ALLOWED Language (Spiritually Framed)

✅ Transform, Discover, Explore, Release, Facilitate, Guide
✅ Inner peace, Clarity, Purpose, Wholeness, Awakening
✅ Journey, Sacred space, Spiritual exploration, Consciousness
✅ Support, Facilitate, Cultivate (not "cure" or "treat")
✅ "Participants report feeling..." (not "this cures...")

### Specific Guidance for Plant Medicine Ads

**Your Retreat Uses Ancestral Plant Medicine** — Extra compliance scrutiny.

**AVOID**:

- Claims it "treats" PTSD, anxiety, depression (even if true)
- Before/after mental health messaging
- Testimonials saying "my anxiety is gone"
- Implication that it replaces therapy or medical care
- Health condition targeting in audience selection

**DO**:

- Frame as "sacred ceremony" + "spiritual exploration"
- Emphasize facilitator training, safety screening, preparation
- Include subtle screening language ("This retreat is for adults seeking deep transformation")
- Discuss integration support post-retreat
- Position as complementary to therapy, not replacement
- Focus on consciousness, spiritual growth, meaning-making

**Landing Page Note**: Your actual landing page can discuss benefits more openly (it's not an ad). Meta only restricts *ad* copy. Use landing pages to educate on healing, integration, and participant selection.

## 13. Sequential Retargeting Strategy (Nurture Funnel)

High-ticket offers require multiple touchpoints. Structure your retargeting sequence:


| **Sequence** | **Audience** | **Goal** | **Ad Focus** | **CTA** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Ad 1: Awareness** | Cold traffic | Stop scroll + emotional recognition | Pain point + curiosity gap | "Learn More" |
| **Ad 2: Consideration** | Website visitors | Build credibility + social proof | Testimonials + facilitator expertise | "Schedule Call" |
| **Ad 3: Decision** | Video viewers (>50%) | Address objections + limited availability | Safety, screening, transformation proof | "Apply Now" / "Claim Spot" |
| **Ad 4: Conversion** | Cart abandoners / Form viewers | Create urgency | Scarcity messaging + final benefit recap | "Reserve Today" |

**Retargeting Audiences in Meta**:

- People who visited website but didn't click CTA

***

## 14. Video Creative Specifications

- **Length**: 8-12 seconds (max 15)
- **Sound**: Assume muted—use captions + visual storytelling
- **First 3 seconds**: Compelling visual (real retreat footage, facilitator, participant transformation moment) with NO text
- **Captions**: Essential (83% watch without sound)[^1]
- **Include**: Real people, authentic emotion, specific location (Tepoztlán visible), facilitator credibility

**What Performs Best**:

- Real participant testimonial videos (43% prefer UGC to branded content)[^15]
- Retreat ceremony footage (sacred, authentic)
- Before/after transformation moments (non-mental-health specific: energy, presence, smile, posture)
- Facilitator expertise shots (years of experience, indigenous lineage)

***

## 15. Landing Page Copywriting (Beyond Ads)

While ads must be compliance-conservative, landing pages can be more direct:

**Landing Page Sections**:

1. **Hero Headline**: "Transform Your Grief Into Wisdom" (specific pain point)
2. **Subheading**: State the problem + promise (e.g., "You've carried this loss alone for years. We create the space to honor it fully.")
3. **Participant Screening Questions**: "This retreat is designed for those who... [emotional readiness, not mental health diagnosis]"
4. **Facilitator Credentials**: Years of experience, lineage, training, safety protocols
5. **Detailed Itinerary**: What to expect (ceremony times, integration sessions, community)
6. **Testimonials Section**: Video testimonials + written quotes (can be more specific than ads)
7. **FAQ**: Address legal concerns, safety, preparation, refund policy
8. **Integration Support**: Follow-up resources, community, ongoing support
9. **Clear CTA**: "Schedule Your 20-Minute Consultation" (not "Buy Now")

***

## 16. Performance Benchmarks to Track

For high-ticket lead generation, track:


| **Metric** | **Industry Average** | **Your Target** | **Why It Matters** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | 1-2% | 2-3% | Video ads + targeted copy should beat average |
| **Cost Per Click (CPC)** | \$0.50-2.00 | \$1-3 | High-ticket = higher CPC acceptable |
| **Cost Per Lead** | \$5-15 | \$20-50 | Lower lead volume, higher quality |
| **Cost Per Booked Call** | \$200-500+ | Track weekly | **Most important metric for your campaign** |
| **Consultation Booking Rate** | 30-50% of leads | 50%+ | Quality targeting matters |
| **Conversion Rate (Consultation → Booking)** | 10-30% | 20-40%+ | High-ticket spiritual work = higher close rates |

**Pro Tip**: Don't optimize for "leads." Optimize for "booked consultations." Your Facebook Pixel should track consultation completions, not just form submissions.

***

## 17. Testing \& Optimization Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**

- Launch 3 campaigns (one per pain point)
- Each campaign: 3 ad variations (primary text)
- Budget: Test with \$20-30/day per campaign
- Track: CTR, CPC, video completion rate

**Phase 2: Scale Winning Elements (Week 3-4)**

- Increase budget on highest CTR ads
- A/B test headlines against winners
- Test different CTAs ("Learn More" vs. "Schedule Call")
- Analyze: Which avatar/pain point combo performs best

**Phase 3: Retargeting (Week 4+)**

- Launch retargeting sequences to warm audiences
- Test testimonial videos vs. facilitator expertise videos
- Refine landing page based on bounce data

**Monthly Review**:

- Cost per booked consultation (must decrease)
- Consultation-to-booking conversion (aim for 25%+ improvement)
- Avatar performance (which avatar has highest lifetime value?)
- Pain point performance (which resonates strongest?)

***

## 18. Final Compliance Checklist

Before launching any ad:

- [ ] No "cure," "heal," "treat," "prevent" language
- [ ] No "guaranteed" or "clinically proven" claims
- [ ] No before/after mental health states shown
- [ ] No specific mental health condition claims (e.g., "cures anxiety")
- [ ] Testimonials don't claim medical outcomes
- [ ] Landing page includes screening questions (emotional readiness, not diagnosis)
- [ ] Facilitator credentials + safety protocols visible
- [ ] Integration support mentioned
- [ ] Legal/medical disclaimer: "This is not a substitute for professional medical care"
- [ ] Separate Spanish campaign (not auto-translated)
- [ ] Spanish copy written by native speaker (Mexico region preferred)

***

## Conclusion

Your retreat occupies a premium position in Mexico's spiritual wellness market. High-converting ads require three aligned elements: (1) emotionally intelligent copy that validates pain without false promises, (2) avatar-specific messaging that matches psychological profiles, and (3) strict Meta compliance that allows transformation language while avoiding medical claims.

The \$2,000-3,000 price point demands quality-focused targeting, not volume-focused campaigns. Success metrics are booked consultations and consultation-to-booking conversion rates, not lead quantity. Spanish-language ads must be transcreated by native speakers who understand Mexican business culture and spiritual traditions.

Your three pain points (grief, purpose, stress) each trigger different emotional drivers and require different copy frameworks. The 9 ad copy variations provided above can be deployed immediately, tested, and optimized based on performance data. Testimonial-driven video content will outperform generic benefit messaging by 50-70%—invest in authentic participant stories.

Run this campaign with 30-50+ ad variations over 60-90 days to gather sufficient data, maintain compliance vigilance with Meta's evolving health/wellness policies, and track cost-per-booked-call as your north star metric.
