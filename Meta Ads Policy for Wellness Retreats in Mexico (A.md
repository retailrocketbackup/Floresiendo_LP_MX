### Meta Ads Policy for Wellness Retreats in Mexico (Ayahuasca, Kambo, Bufo Alvarius)

Meta (Facebook/Instagram) has strict advertising standards and automated review systems that heavily regulate ads for wellness retreats, especially those offering plant medicines and psychoactive substances like ayahuasca, kambo, and bufo alvarius. Understanding the nuances is crucial for running successful, compliant campaigns in Mexico.

#### 1. **Meta Ad Restrictions for Plant Medicine Retreats**

- Advertisers are **prohibited** from running ads that promote the sale or use of illicit or recreational drugs, unsafe substances, or supplements determined by Meta at its sole discretion. This includes retreat packages where plant medicines, especially psychoactive ones, are a feature.[^1]
- Ads **cannot promote or offer the sale of THC products or cannabis products containing psychoactive components**. Even for hemp or cannabinoid products, only non-ingestible CBD is permitted and typically only with LegitScript certification and Meta’s written authorization for certain countries.[^2][^1]
- For Mexico, **hemp products can be promoted as long as they do not contain CBD or psychoactive elements** and the ads comply with local laws, codes, and licenses.[^2][^1]


#### 2. **Relevant Triggers for Ad Rejection**

- **Explicit references** to ayahuasca, kambo, bufo alvarius, or similar substances may trigger rejection if perceived as promoting the use of psychoactive substances. Meta scrapes the landing page and associated content to identify restricted topics—even indirect mentions on your website can affect approval.[^3][^4]
- Even broad wellness language can be risky if **health claims** are made (e.g., statements such as “transform your health”, “psychedelic-assisted healing”, or guarantees about physical changes).[^5][^4]
- Ads with “too good to be true” claims, unsubstantiated testimonials, or lacking transparency may be flagged or rejected as deceptive.[^4]


#### 3. **January 2025 Policy Updates**

- In 2025, Meta increased restrictions on health/wellness ads to protect user privacy and limit the use of sensitive health data in campaigns. These updates impact targeting and optimization, making it harder to use lower-funnel events (like direct purchases/bookings) for plant medicine/wellness ads in Mexico.[^6]
- Even businesses not directly in health/wellness but adjacent can be flagged, and broad categorization by Meta’s AI drives increased scrutiny.


#### 4. **Recommended Compliance Strategies**

- **Avoid direct references to prohibited substances**: Use broader wellness terms—focus on experience (nature, mindfulness, group therapy) and retreat activities (yoga, meditation, art therapy). Reserve explicit substance names for organic content outside paid ads.
- Ensure **website compliance** with Meta’s ad review—remove restricted terms on event or landing pages linked to ads, as Meta’s crawlers check destination URLs.
- Do **not make direct health claims** or promises of healing/cure; instead, describe “integration,” “support,” and “personal growth.”
- Use disclaimer language and provide transparency regarding compliance with Mexican laws (licenses, staff credentials).
- **Constantly review policy updates** and audit campaigns/websites to maintain compliance and effectiveness under new Meta rules.[^4][^6]


#### 5. **Additional Considerations**

- Protect your ad account by getting your business verified and maintaining high trust signals for Meta (business verification, stable payment methods, compliance documentation).[^7]
- If an ad is rejected, appeals can be requested within Meta, but repeated violations or risky ad language may result in broader account restrictions.[^7]

***

Meta’s evolving policy landscape makes compliance in plant medicine and wellness retreat advertising a moving target in Mexico. Advertisers must regularly update campaigns, use cautious and indirect language, avoid all medical or psychoactive claims, and keep both ad and website content free of sensitive references to remain competitive and avoid account penalties.[^3][^5][^1][^6][^2][^4][^7]
