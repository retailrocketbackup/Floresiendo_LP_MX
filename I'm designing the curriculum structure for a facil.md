# I'm designing the curriculum structure for a facilitator training school focused on ancestral wellness practices (plant medicine ceremonies, breathwork, integration therapy). The program is 7 cycles, 4 days each (28 total days spread over months).

Please research and provide:

## 1. Benchmark Programs

- What is the typical structure of facilitator/practitioner training programs in:
    - Psychedelic-assisted therapy (MAPS, Fluence, CIIS, Naropa)
    - Breathwork facilitator certifications (Holotropic, Wim Hof, Soma)
    - Somatic therapy training (Somatic Experiencing, Hakomi)
    - Traditional curanderismo/shamanic apprenticeships
- How many hours/days do these programs typically require?
- What is the ratio of theory vs. experiential practice?


## 2. Learning Progression Models

- What pedagogical frameworks work best for experiential/somatic learning?
- How do successful programs sequence skill development (foundational → advanced)?
- What is the optimal spacing between intensive modules for integration?
- How do programs balance personal development with professional skills?


## 3. Core Competency Areas

- What competencies do regulatory bodies (like MAPS, IPI, or state boards) require for facilitators?
- What are the essential safety and crisis intervention skills?
- What ethical frameworks are standard in this field?
- What integration and follow-up protocols are considered best practice?


## 4. Assessment \& Certification

- How do similar programs assess competency (not just attendance)?
- What supervised practice hours are typically required before independent work?
- What continuing education requirements exist post-certification?
- How do programs handle students who aren't ready to facilitate?


## 5. Program Differentiation

- What makes top-tier programs stand out from basic certifications?
- What alumni outcomes or success metrics do leading programs track?
- How do international programs differ from US/Mexico-based ones?


## 6. Practical Considerations

- What is the typical cohort size for experiential training?
- What staff-to-student ratio is recommended for safety?
- What pre-requisites do programs require (personal experience, therapy hours, etc.)?
- How do programs handle contraindications and screening?

Focus on programs that emphasize safety, ethics, and integration over ceremonial dogma. I'm particularly interested in hybrid models that combine ancestral wisdom with modern therapeutic frameworks.

Provide specific examples, hour counts, and curriculum outlines where available.

Now I have comprehensive research completed. Let me create the final comprehensive report for the user.

### 2. Learning Progression \& Pedagogical Frameworks

#### Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle[^25][^26][^27]

The most widely applied framework for facilitator training programs structures learning through four interconnected stages:

1. **Concrete Experience** - Direct, immediate experiences (real patients/clients, actual sessions)
2. **Reflective Observation** - Systematic analysis and reflection on experiences
3. **Abstract Conceptualization** - Theoretical learning and pattern identification
4. **Active Experimentation** - Applying learning in new situations with practice/feedback

This cycle operates on a spiral: each iteration moves to higher levels of competence. Programs integrate these stages by combining clinical practice, supervision seminars, theoretical instruction, and simulation/role-play practice.[^27]

#### Somatic Learning Modalities[^28][^29][^19]

**Embodied Learning Principles:**

- Internal sensation focus over external appearance
- Habitual pattern recognition and re-education
- Body-mind connection emphasizing felt sense
- Integration of neuroscience research on developmental movement

**Key Somatic Methods Taught:**

- Laban Movement Analysis (movement observation and documentation)
- Bartenieff Fundamentals (developmental patterns, efficiency of movement)
- Body-Mind Centering (anatomical awareness through movement exploration)
- Authentic Movement (witness + mover model with eyes closed, internal impulse following)
- Feldenkrais method elements
- Experiential anatomy

**Authentic Movement as Therapeutic Tool**[^30][^31]

- **Structure:** Two basic roles - Mover (eyes closed, self-directed movement) and Witness (non-judgmental observation)
- **Application:** Personal expression, deepening self-awareness, embodied consciousness
- **Foundation:** Janet Adler's Discipline of Authentic Movement integrates Buddhist psychology, mindfulness, mysticism
- **Benefit:** Fosters speaking from embodied felt sense, verbal and non-verbal expression


#### Optimal Module Spacing \& Integration

**Research on Experiential Learning** suggests:

- **4-6 day modules spaced weeks/months apart** allow for integration between learning events[^17][^16]
- **Two-week to one-month intervals** optimal for reflective observation and personal practice
- **Home groups (7-9 students, bi-weekly 90 minutes)** provide continuity and peer support between intensives[^8]
- **Breaks for rest and integration** (April, August, December) improve retention and embodiment[^32]

**Integration Phase Duration:**

- Professional post-experience integration requires structured time (not rushed)
- Mentors report that spacing allows students to practice newly learned skills before next module
- Back-to-back modules reduce opportunity for embodied learning

***

### 3. Core Competency Areas \& Ethical Frameworks

#### Six Core Therapist Competencies (Janis Phelps International Standard)[^33][^34][^35]

**1. Empathetic Abiding Presence**

- Cultivated calm, steady presence during preparation, session, and integration
- Components: Composure, evenly suspended attention, mindfulness, empathetic listening, "doing by non-doing"
- Equanimity: Ability to move gracefully with ebb/flow of unique sessions

#### 12 Fundamental Curricular Domains[^34]

The training curriculum must systematically address:

1. **History of Clinical Research \& Legal Status** - Contextual understanding of field development and regulatory environment
2. **Neurobiology \& Neuropharmacology** - Mechanisms, drug disposition, interactions, contraindications
3. **Best Practices in Set \& Setting** - Preparation protocols, session management, integration practices
4. **Therapeutic Relationships \& Ethics** - Transference analysis, boundaries, ethical standards, facilitator self-care
5. **Supervised Observation** - Video review of real therapy sessions with expert analysis
6. **Therapeutic Model Variations** - Client-centered, psycholytic, and other modalities
7. **Complementary Techniques** - Somatic, breathwork, art, ritual, integration methods
8. **Co-therapy \& Multidisciplinary Skills** - Team dynamics, interprofessional collaboration

**Psychedelic Harm Reduction \& Integration (PHRI) Approach**[^38]

- Non-judgmental, open-minded listening
- Focus on understanding over agreement
- Active practice of non-harming speech
- Mirroring techniques
- Avoidance of unsolicited advice or interpretation
- Support for participant's intuitive process and autonomy

### 4. Assessment \& Certification Models

#### Competency-Driven Training Approach[^40]

Rather than attendance-based certification, modern programs increasingly use **competency assessment:**

- **Pre-training Assessment:** Baseline evaluation of facilitators' existing skills using standardized tools
- **During-Training Assessment:** Regular role-plays and competency checks inform real-time curriculum adjustments
- **Post-training Assessment:** Comprehensive evaluation of demonstrated competencies
- **Feedback Culture:** Peer and trainer feedback on skill development
- **Adaptive Training:** Trainer adjusts focus based on specific cohort weaknesses

**Assessment Tools:**

- **WeACT** (Working with children-Assessment of Competencies Tool): 13 items
- **ENACT** (ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors): 15 items
- **GroupACT** (Group facilitation: Assessment of Competencies Tool): 6 items
- **Role-play scenarios:** Standardized situations for observation and rating
- **Mock sessions:** Unstructured practice with real participants

**Research Finding:** Competency-driven training reduced harmful behaviors to near-absence and improved specific skill areas compared to training-as-usual.[^40]

#### Supervised Practice Hour Requirements

**Oregon \& Colorado Standards**[^41][^42][^43][^8]
