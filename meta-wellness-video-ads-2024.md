### 4. **DYNAMIC CREATIVE OPTIMIZATION (DCO) — AI-POWERED SCALING**

**What It Is:**
Meta uploads multiple creative components (5-30 assets) — images, videos, headlines, copy variations, CTAs — and AI automatically tests thousands of combinations across audience segments in real-time.

**How It Works for Wellness:**

**Upload 5-10 Creative Components:**
- 3-4 video variations (testimonial, expert, lifestyle, problem-solution)
- 2-3 headline variations (problem-first, benefit-first, curiosity-hook)
- 2-3 description copy variations (short benefit statement, long story, objection-addressing)
- 2 CTA button variations ("Reserve Spot" vs. "Learn More")

**Meta's AI Tests Combinations Like:**
- Video A + Headline B + Copy A + CTA 2
- Video C + Headline A + Copy B + CTA 1
- etc.

**Results:**
- 30-50% performance improvement documented
- Reduced manual A/B testing burden
- Lower CPM through personalization
- Automatic audience matching (who sees what creative)

**Example DCO Setup for Meditation Retreat:**

| Component | Variation 1 | Variation 2 | Variation 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Video** | 15s testimonial | Expert intro + demo | Before/after transformation |
| **Headline** | "Racing Thoughts?" | "Sleep Better in 15 Minutes" | "Brain Fog? Here's the Reset" |
| **Description** | "Join 500+ professionals" | "Science-backed meditation" | "Free live session, no experience needed" |
| **Primary CTA** | "Reserve Free Spot" | "Learn More" | "Join Now" |

Meta tests all 27 combinations and optimizes spend toward best performers.

**DCO Performance Metrics:**
- Performance improvement: 30-50% above static creative
- Cost per result: 20-40% reduction
- Audience reach: More people see personally optimized creative
- Relevance score: Higher (better positioning)

## PART 2: OPTIMAL VIDEO LENGTH & PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Video Length Recommendations by Objective:

| Objective | Optimal Length | Secondary Length | Performance Note |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| **Awareness/Brand Recall** | 6-15 seconds | 20-30 seconds | Shorter is better; punchy hook crucial |
| **Consideration (Traffic)** | 15-30 seconds | 30-60 seconds | Time for storytelling + benefit |
| **Conversion (Sales/Leads)** | 15-30 seconds | Up to 60 seconds | Testimonial + CTA strong at 15-30s |
| **Reels-Specific** | 15-30 seconds | 6-15 seconds for bumpers | Meta prioritizes 15-30s in algorithm |
| **In-Stream Video** | 5-15 seconds | 15-30 seconds | Short hook, clearable after 5s |
| **Stories Ads** | 6-15 seconds | Full screen, 2-min max | Quick dismissible, fast message |

## PART 3: SOUND-ON vs. SOUND-OFF OPTIMIZATION

### Critical Insight: 68% of Users Watch Sound-OFF

**Platform Default:** Most Meta ads auto-play muted. Sound is optional.

**What This Means:**
Your video MUST work completely without sound to capture 68% of viewers.

### Sound-OFF Optimization Checklist:

✓ **Burned-in Captions** (mandatory)
- Minimum font size: Large enough to read on mobile (test on 5" screen)
- Placement: Avoid bottom 35% (Instagram UI covers)
- High contrast (white text + black outline, or reverse)
- Motion text: Appears at right time (matches action/dialogue)

✓ **High-Contrast Visuals**
- Color contrast ratio 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG standard)
- Avoid light text on light backgrounds, dark on dark
- Use motion/scene changes to indicate importance

✓ **Visual Storytelling**
- Video must tell story through visuals alone
- Examples:
  - Person looking tired (0-2s) → Person meditating (2-8s) → Person smiling/alert (8-13s)
  - Problem state visualization → Solution → Result

✓ **Text Overlay Strategy**
- Header text (main message): 2-3 words, 4-6 seconds duration
- Testimonial text (quote): Full quote or key phrases
- CTA text: Bold, contrasting color, appears at 10-12s mark

**Example Caption Timing (15-Second Video):**
- 0-2s: "Can't Sleep?"
- 2-4s: "Racing Thoughts?"
- 4-8s: [Testimonial text] "Fell asleep for the first time in 3 years"
- 8-13s: [Result] "Now sleeping 2+ hours deeper"
- 13-15s: [CTA] "Join 500+ This Week — Reserve Free"

### When to Optimize for Sound-ON:

For 32% who watch with sound:

✓ **Audio Hook** (first 1-2 seconds)
- Start with compelling sound element immediately
- Don't rely on voiceover intro; lead with music/ambient sound
- Example: Peaceful meditation bell sound OR energetic music for transformation

✓ **Voiceover Strategies** (if sound-on)
- First-person testimonial (speaker sharing story) = highest engagement
- Calming voiceover guide (meditation leader voice) = authority building
- Energetic upbeat voiceover (transformation narrative) = motivational

✓ **Music Selection**
- Wellness: Ambient, nature sounds, soft instrumental (60-80 BPM)
- Transformation: Uplifting, progressive (tempo increases with energy)
- Avoid: Distracting, overly trendy, copyrighted music (use Meta/Epidemic Sound library)

**Audio Performance Data:**
- Videos with sound engage 12-15% more on sound-on viewership
- BUT silent-optimized videos convert at similar rates (strong visuals matter more)
- Recommendation: Optimize for sound-OFF first, add audio as enhancement
